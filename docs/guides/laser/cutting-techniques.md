# Cutting Techniques

## Types of Cuts

There are many cut and burn types available with the laser cutter. All of these differ depending on the laser power applied and the laser movement speed, but they can be simplified down to two main types: 'Cutting' and 'Burning'.  
A 'cut' is used to cut through a piece of material completely - as the name suggests, it completely separates a piece of material from another.  
A 'burn' is a lot more _variable_ - it can be used to etch designs, 'engrave' a pattern, or even [sketch a picture](../images).  

## Cuts

A 'cut' is a burn that passes all the way through the material. It is used for separating pieces of work - removing sections to create a negative space, or cutting around a design to remove it from the sheet of material.  
It is also used to remove a finished piece of work from the main sheet after your work has completed processing.
