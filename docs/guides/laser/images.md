# Working with images on the laser cutter

## Coming Soon

Some proper notes on how to achieve image details using Lightburn will be added soon, but there are a few good guides on how to get images to burn in (similar to a charcoal sketch) on YouTube.  
One that has been referenced with some success is [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4to-VHA0do).  

Note that the laser burn width on the Haututu laser cutter is 0.1mm, so the Line Interval for the image cannot be below 0.1mm. If you go below this, each line will overlap the previous one, resulting in the image blurring significantly (like someone smudged ink before it dried).
