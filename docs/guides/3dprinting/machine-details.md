# Machine Details

The Hacklab has three separate 3D Printers (yes, _three_).

There is a BambuLabs X1 Carbon (with the 'AMS' unit), and there are 2 FlashForge Adventurer 5M Pro units.


## Specs

Each of the machines behaves a little differently - and the Bambu unit has an extra capability that the FlashForges do not (quickly switching filaments mid-job).  

### BambuLabs X1 Carbon

| Filaments |  PLA, PETG, TPU, ABS, ASA, PVA, PET, PA, PC<br>Carbon / Glass Fibre Reinforced Polymer<br>_Note that Carbon and Fibreglass will cause extra wear on the print nozzle_.|

#### AMS

The 'Bambu Lab Automatic Material System' allows you to load several different filaments in for use in a single print job.  
This could be multiple colours or multiple materials, or multiple partial rolls of filament for the printer to automatically change rolls when what's left on a roll runs out.  
The AMS also senses when filament tangles or fails to feed, which stops printing to help reduce failed prints - which also reduces wastage. 

**_Why would this be useful, beyond pretty colours?_**  
If you are doing a complex print that requires _supports_ to be used, then you could have the print use a whole separate colour for the support structures - which will make identifying when all the supports have been cut away that much easier.
