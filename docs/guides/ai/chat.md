# Chatbots and talking with LLMs

The AI station is set up for chatting with AI models.

## Running

Open WebUI should be started by default and running in the background (through Docker). This uses the Ollama service for text generation.

To use open your browser to [127.0.0.1:3000](http://127.0.0.1:3000).

## Using

You can simply type in the message box to start chatting with the default language model.

Using the dropdown at the top of the screen you can switch between installed models. Some are more understanding than others, and run at different speeds.

### Documents

Using the Plus icon (+) next to your message input, you can upload files (such as text, or PDF) to be inserted into the chat context.

This can useful to ask an LLM questions about a document, or to provide summaries, etc.
