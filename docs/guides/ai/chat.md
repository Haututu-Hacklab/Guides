# Chatbots and talking with LLMs

The AI station is set up for chatting with AI models.

TODO write this while at the Hacklab...

## Running

Make sure that Ollama is running, and open your browser to [127.0.0.1:8080](http://127.0.0.1:8080).

## Using

You can simply type in the message box to start chatting with the default language model.

Using the dropdown at the top of the screen you can switch between installed models. Some are more understanding than others, and run at different speeds.

### Documents

Using the Plus icon (+) next to your message input, you can upload files (such as text, or PDF) to be inserted into the chat context.

This can useful to ask an LLM questions about a document, or to provide summaries, etc.
